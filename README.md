ChatGPT said my C++ skill level is a 6/10, personally I'd say I'm a 4/10, anyways lets how good of an Anti-Cheat a 6 can make, LOL.

## About

user-mode anti-chat and anti-tamper software for educational purposes and fun. This project is an opportunity for me to practice my C++ and Windows internal knowledge. The software will help protect users from unwanted communication and tampering attempts.

## Cheat Detection

This project will mainly focus on Activision's 2022 MW2/WZ2. You can basically call this project "Open source usermode [Ricochet](https://www.callofduty.com/warzone/ricochet)"  (I'm joking)

**Detecting Cheat Developer Drivers** 

*ModernWarfareIICheats.h* has a few driver names + MD5 hashes / sigs I've calculated of known undetect cheats, which i know is facts becaue I've put in the work to know... I will probably NOT do anything with this list other than just addon to it, or not. I will not be listing the provider names of these signatures, if you really wish to know you can message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-terry-8582101b7/)

**Other Software Being Detected**

* CheatEngine - Reads process memory for known strings & searches every process for its image name + internal / original name.


### Future

No clue... Anti-Cheat & Anti-Virus software are kind of passion projects for me, so I'll probably continue adding to this project over time or focus on something else like AV, basically they are the same thing.
